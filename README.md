# Life in parens: simulating an ecosystem with Clojure

This code is accompanied by [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQqrNNCxcWHpGBT9FPJF4oqltMtq5A8KqeH4MNLv1EMvOq4DXYZ6XwAdavNQXbHLOvjwM0mKkuEIpib/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000) of my ClojureD talk.

Nature is the sum of a large amount of complex ecosystems, where different species coexist in a fragile equilibrium.

In this talk, we will simulate our very own ecosystem with Clojure, and explore emerging patterns under simple sets of rules.

We will have the chance of creating our own little creatures and observe them thrive, compete and evolve, as they struggle for their own existence.
